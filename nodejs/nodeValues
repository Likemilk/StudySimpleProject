# Usage

# To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:

##  nvm install node
# And then in any new shell just use the installed version:

## nvm use node
# Or you can just run it:

## nvm run node --version
# Or, you can run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node:

## nvm exec 4.2 node --version
# You can also get the path to the executable to where it was installed:

## nvm which 5.0
# In place of a version pointer like "0.10" or "5.0" or "4.2.1", you can use the following special default aliases with nvm install, nvm use, nvm run, nvm exec, nvm which, etc:

# node: this installs the latest version of node
# iojs: this installs the latest version of io.js
# stable: this alias is deprecated, and only truly applies to node v0.12 and earlier. Currently, this is an alias for node.
# unstable: this alias points to node v0.11 - the last "unstable" node release, since post-1.0, all node versions are stable. (in semver, versions communicate breakage, not stability).
# Long-term support

# Node has a schedule for long-term support (LTS) You can reference LTS versions in aliases and .nvmrc files with the notation lts/* for the latest LTS, and lts/argon for LTS releases from the "argon" line, for example. In addition, the following commands support LTS arguments:

## nvm install --lts / nvm install --lts=argon / nvm install 'lts/*' / nvm install lts/argon
## nvm uninstall --lts / nvm uninstall --lts=argon / nvm uninstall 'lts/*' / nvm uninstall lts/argon
## nvm use --lts / nvm use --lts=argon / nvm use 'lts/*' / nvm use lts/argon
## nvm exec --lts / nvm exec --lts=argon / nvm exec 'lts/*' / nvm exec lts/argon
## nvm run --lts / nvm run --lts=argon / nvm run 'lts/*' / nvm run lts/argon
## nvm ls-remote --lts / nvm ls-remote --lts=argon nvm ls-remote 'lts/*' / nvm ls-remote lts/argon
## nvm version-remote --lts / nvm version-remote --lts=argon / nvm version-remote 'lts/*' / nvm version-remote lts/argon
