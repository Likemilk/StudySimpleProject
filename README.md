# ubuntu-config
This project is for my ubuntu initial setting on vmware-tools
1. set-ubuntu.sh is normal ubuntu setting 
2. set-vmware.sh is just install about vmware-tools


# Installation
it is simple but,it need to follow this guide correctly. because of this shell script is wrack.

``` bash
#go to your Home
cd ~
#clone this git
git clone https://github.com/Likemilk/ubuntu-config
cd ubuntu-config
#run below first. and read this file (there are some helpful comments)
./set-ubuntu.sh 
#run below file second. and read this file( there are some helpful comments)
./set-vmware.sh 
cd ~ 
 rm -rf ~/ubuntu-config
```
the initial setting is done. **Congratulation.**
